# Jumbo No-Code Builder - Prompting Documentation

This document tracks all user prompts and system responses for the Jumbo No-Code Builder project.

## Prompt History

### 2025-01-27 - Initial Project Setup
**User Prompt:**
```
Instructions:
1. Please make sure to add all the prompts requested by user and systems response in docs-> PROMPTING.md file along with timestamp.
2. Please make sure to update the readme.md for all the projects in the docs folder and always update it along with requirements.md and technicaldetails.md file present in docs folder.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

**User Prompt:**
```
New Feature:
In the Design tab, The user should be able to download a sample control library template - a excel template.
This template will already have a rows of values filled in it with examples of all the controls present in it.
For the list of controls to be added in this template, Please add a first sheet which will be called Instructions and in that add all the controls available. There will be a separate sheet called Design that will have all the sample values of controls added for all the controls added from the control library.
The user will be using the Import excel feature to upload the data once they fill. The values added by the user in the design tab will be load into the Design tab. The user will be able to further modify or add further control after that and be able to view the preview of all the controls added. 
Also when the user saves the details the design all the details will be saved in the db.
```

### 2025-01-27 - Excel Import Visibility Fix and Enhanced Examples
**User Prompt:**
```
When the user import the excel template, the fields present in the excel are showed which is good but not able to see the controls added in the design tab.
Also Please update examples for all the controls in the design tab included the required field in the design and relevant screens
```

**System Response:**
- Fixed Excel import visibility issue by adding refresh mechanism to useDragDrop hook
- Added refreshKey state to App component to force control refresh after import
- Enhanced Excel template with comprehensive real-world examples across multiple sections:

### 2025-01-27 - Excel Import Design Canvas Visibility Fix (First Attempt)
**User Prompt:**
```
Once the user imports the excel template, the controls are not loaded in the design screen, can you please fix.
```

**System Response (First Attempt):**
- **Root Cause Identified**: Controls weren't appearing in design canvas after Excel import due to insufficient refresh mechanism
