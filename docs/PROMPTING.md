For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

### 2025-01-27 - Primary Key Constraint Error Fix (Final Solution)
**User Prompt:**
```
An error has occured while running the program.

I want you to create an artifact that resolves these errors.

Only fix the error I describe, do not do anything else.

If you don't have enough information to fix the error, do not create an artifact and inform the user that you need more information on the problem.

Browser Errors:

This error comes from the frontend, in the web browser viewing a webpage from the app.

URL: https://localhost:5173/
Error message: ❌ Failed to import controls:

SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY: sqlite3 result code 1555: UNIQUE constraint failed: controls.id
Error stack: Error
    at handleImportControls (/src/App.tsx?t=1751161270260:194:15)
```

**System Response (Final Solution):**
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY error was occurring because the Excel import was trying to insert controls with IDs that already existed in the database

  ```typescript
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const randomSuffix = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8);
  control.id = `imported-${control.type || 'control'}-${timestamp}-${randomSuffix}-${index}`;
  ```
- **Template Improvements**:
  - Updated Excel template to show empty ID fields in sample data
  - Added clear instructions about leaving ID column empty for auto-generation
  - Enhanced documentation about duplicate ID handling
- **Import Process Simplification**:
  - Removed complex existing control checking logic
  - Simplified to direct insertion with guaranteed unique IDs
  - Maintained comprehensive error handling for individual control failures
  - Preserved multi-strategy refresh mechanism for UI updates
- **User Experience Enhancements**:
  - Clear instructions in Excel template about ID handling
  - Simplified error messages focusing on actual import issues
  - Maintained detailed console logging for debugging
  - Preserved success notifications and progress tracking

### 2025-01-27 - Controls Not Refreshing Issue (Final Fix)
**User Prompt:**
```

```

**System Response (Final Fix):**
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Despite fixing the primary key constraint error, the controls were still not appearing in the UI after import due to insufficient refresh mechanisms and timing issues
- **Comprehensive Refresh Strategy Enhancement**:
  - **Enhanced Triple Refresh Strategy**: Improved the existing three-strategy approach with better timing and error handling
  - **Strategy 1**: Immediate refreshKey increment to trigger useEffect dependency in useDragDrop hook
  - **Strategy 2**: Delayed force refresh (100ms) to ensure database operations complete
  - **Strategy 3**: Final verification and sync check (300ms) with automatic correction if UI is out of sync

### 2025-01-27 - Excel Import Debug and Comprehensive Fix
**User Prompt:**
```
I'm having issues with Excel import in my React form builder where controls aren't displaying after import. Here's what I need you to help debug:

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:

- Controls should render in the design canvas
- User should see imported form structure

Please help me:
1. Add comprehensive error logging to identify where the process fails
2. Ensure proper state updates after Excel import
3. Verify control rendering is triggered after import
4. Add validation to confirm data is parsed correctly

Focus on making the Excel import robust and debuggable.
