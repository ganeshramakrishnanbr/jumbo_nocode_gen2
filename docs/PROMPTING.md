# Jumbo No-Code Builder - Prompting Documentation

This document tracks all user prompts and system responses for the Jumbo No-Code Builder project.

## Prompt History

### 2025-01-27 - Initial Project Setup
**User Prompt:**
```
Instructions:
1. Please make sure to add all the prompts requested by user and systems response in docs-> PROMPTING.md file along with timestamp.
2. Please make sure to update the readme.md for all the projects in the docs folder and always update it along with requirements.md and technicaldetails.md file present in docs folder.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
